# DeepLearningAssignment

This is a simple deep learning project, on a given dataset. It is done as a part of an assignment.

The predictions file is in the folder along with the data provided. The model is trained using
trainX.pickle and trainY.pickle. And predictions are processed on testX.pickle. 
All these files are in Assignment3 folder.

Basic convolutional neural networks using keras are used.

Please take your time to go through the minimalistic features of this project at your leisure.

Cheers!
